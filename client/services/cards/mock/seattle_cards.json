            "description": "Seattle has its fair share of diverse eats but not every cuisine is represented. For many years Seattleites have been missing out on Burmese cuisine, until now. Uptown\u2019s Kamino Sushi and More is quietly serving up some of the country\u2019s most popular dishes and you can try them. The restaurant describes itself as serving up \u201ctraditional sushi recipes blended with modern, mind blowing flavours.\u201d What\u2019s more, the restaurant has partnered with Master Chef Tin Tin Oo, the Season One winner of Master Chef of Myanmar in 2018-19. Her 12 years of experience in the art of Japanese Burmese cuisine inform the dishes that Kamino serves.
