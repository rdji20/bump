So Lazy Cow Bakery is associated with\u00a0the social justice organization, La Casa Del Xoloitzcuintle. It\u2019s a \u201cLatinx mutual aid organization that responds to the needs of the community.\u201d The bakery comes into play here because it has a free community fridge & food pantry and donations are welcome anytime during the bakery\u2019s normal business hours. So you can eat your cake and give it too. For now, Lazy Cow is offering beautiful Valentine\u2019s Day boxes one for $25 that comes with a slice of\u00a0red velvet cake topped with a chocolate strawberry and an almond croissant. And another in partnership with Frelard Tamales for $124 that comes with\u00a015 mini tamales, flowers, vegan candles, and a taster box of Lazy Cow\u2019s goodies.

As of last week, they\u2019re the newest restaurant in Capitol Hill. Blotto is known for its thin-crust New York and Neapolitan-style pizza which took Broadway Alley by storm. Like many other local pop-up spots, they were often sold out within hours. With a focus on quality over quantity and use of local ingredients, that\u2019s not too surprising.

But! We do really like drinking and know a good spot when we see it.  Which is why taking a look inside Canon was an easy choice for us. As one of the best bars in America, this low-key bar has certainly made the nation\u2019s canon (haha, nice).  We will start things off with their food menu. Small plates dominate, allowing for guests to nibble away as they try drink after delicious drink. They\u2019ve got a few larger options too, like skirt steak and duck cassoulet. You know, just in case your dinner wasn\u2019t up to par.  Moving on, their cocktail menu reflects an intense dedication to both past and present. Manhattans, mules and sharing drinks rest beside international concoctions and house creations. Frankly, it\u2019s a long list and one that would take the average person months to get through.  Of course, you\u2019re not going to find a better cocktail in the city, so we think that you should get a move on.  Canon also has the largest selection of spirits in the Western Hemisphere, sitting at a whopping 4,000 bottles and counting. The 192-page (good lord) menu has everything from $7 shots of tequila to things you have never seen before.  And we mean that- there are bottles at Canon from the late 1800s, often costing over $800 a pour. Might as well make ours a double, right?

Next, grab some of their signature Hunan-style Chili Cumin Pork Ribs. You\u2019ve got two options for these- a bit spicy or extra spicy.

Even if you don\u2019t grab a large plate or a side, make sure you end your meal with their incredible creamsicles. You can choose between Thai-Iced Tea, Cherry Coconut or Vietnamese coffee.

A time-honored tradition, and one done extremely well at Needle and Thread. This speakeasy located above the already popular Tavern Law is a great late night date spot.\u00a0Here\u2019s a quick look at what to do at one of Seattle\u2019s most low-key speakeasies. Related Posts:\nThe Pink Door is Seattle\u2019s best dinner and a show\n5 New Seattle Restaurants You\u2019ve Gotta Check Out  First things first, let\u2019s get into the bar. You\u2019re not going to be able to enjoy Needle and Thread if you can\u2019t thread your own needle into the place. The only real strategy is to make reservations ahead of time on their website. Then, put on your best late-night duds. Men, wax your mustaches\u00a0(if you\u2019ve got one). Ladies, plump those eyelashes (if you\u2019ve got two). When you\u2019re ready, head to the back of Tavern Law, pick up the telephone, provide the password (from your reservation) and enter through a bank vault.  Once you\u2019re in, you might be surprised to find out that there\u2019s no menu. Instead, the bartender will figure out your taste preferences and craft one for you from memory. A great approach, just so long as you know what you\u2019re feeling for that night. If you don\u2019t want to fully pretend like it\u2019s the prohibition, then you can always just grab something from Tavern Law instead.

And you could probably use a walk or quick drive.JTNDZGl2JTIwaWQlM0QlMjJtb2JpbGUtYWQtb25seSUyMiUzRSUwQSUzQyUyMS0tJTIwU2VhdHRsZSUyMC0lMjBNb2JpbGUlMjAtLSUzRSUwQSUzQ2lucyUyMGNsYXNzJTNEJTIyYWRzYnlnb29nbGUlMjIlMEElMjAlMjAlMjAlMjAlMjBzdHlsZSUzRCUyMmRpc3BsYXklM0FibG9jayUzQndpZHRoJTNBMzIwcHglM0JoZWlnaHQlM0E1MHB4JTNCJTIyJTBBJTIwJTIwJTIwJTIwJTIwZGF0YS1hZC1jbGllbnQlM0QlMjJjYS1wdWItNTUyMTg1Njk1NTQ5NzQ1NiUyMiUwQSUyMCUyMCUyMCUyMCUyMGRhdGEtYWQtc2xvdCUzRCUyMjE2MjcxNzI5NDclMjIlM0UlM0MlMkZpbnMlM0UlMEElM0MlMkZkaXYlM0U= ","when":"Multiple locations","where":"ns: Takeout or delivery","linkImage":"","explorer":"curiocity","explorer_reference_link":"https:\/\/curiocity.com\/seattle\/","city":"Seattle"},{"index":502,"title":"Christmas Burger: $21","description":" It\u2019s a straight-up Christmas feast stuffed between two buns, you guys. You\u2019ll get crispy chicken breast, melted white cheddar on a sausage patty, caramelized onion, bacon, cranberry sauce and crisp cabbage stacked on a bed of peppercorn gravy. Oh, it also comes with fries on the side (in case that didn\u2019t sound like enough heavenly food already). Plus, it pairs perfectly with Guinness, the quintessential cozy-by-the-fire-beer that kicks up the Christmas spirit with every sip. Guinness\u2019 roasted notes complement the Christmas Burger\u2019s crispy chicken, sausage, bason, and white cheddar, while the natural bitterness of the beer contrasts the sweet caramelized onions, and it\u2019s all brought together by the intensity of the cranberry sauce. Oh, and we haven\u2019t even gotten to the best part yet. From December 7th to December 13th, you can get the Christmas Burger for only $12.25 through either DoorDash pick-up or delivery.

Perhaps one of the most unique is Prosser\u2019s Gravity Hill. As the name suggests, this hill appears to defy gravity as it is known to \u201cpull\u201d cars up a \u00a0minor incline on the road. You can make the trip east to test it out yourself, but be prepared for an inexplicable experience. So how does one use the hill? All you have to do is make the drive east and put your car into neutral at the \u2018Start\u2019 line painted on Crosby road, et voila! You\u2019re magically pulled up the hill! According to Atlas Obscura, the grain elevator at the end of the road is haunted. And while we tend to take these things with a grain of salt, we wouldn\u2019t expect anything less from a site that offers a seemingly impossible experience. Now before you get too spooked, people have many theories about why the hill does what it does. Some of those theories include optical illusions and of course, the \u2018haunted\u2019 grain elevator, but the real explanation might not be as exciting as the latter. Magnetic or \u2018gravity\u2019 hills exist all over the world, and one simple explanation is that these small inclines are part of larger declines that we can\u2019t see or process, causing us to believe that we\u2019re being pulled upwards.

While the road is public access keep in mind that the land around it is privately owned. And of course, use your best judgment and be safe when checking out this phenomenon. As always if you give it a go be sure to let us know what happens and maybe even take a video or two because we\u2019ll admit, we\u2019re curious.

The Chehalis Centralia Railroad is one of the only steam-powered railroads in the state. And to make things even more special, you can only ride the train seasonally. On weekends you can choose between two different train excursions. The first being the Chehalis Valley Coach Ride Excursion, a\u00a0 13-mile round trip ride to Milburn. You\u2019ll pass by views of wooded forests, old farmsteads, country homes, and tranquil nature sites.

On this extended run, you\u2019ll follow alongside the Chehalis River and see its lush riverbanks, forests, and farmlands. Both rides are a great way to spend a day on a weekend and are only happening until September 25th. So run, don\u2019t walk folks because you don\u2019t want to miss out on riding a historic train. Now we will say the steam locomotive is currently being repaired but your train trip will still be just as spectacular as these locomotives and cars are historic. It\u2019s certainly not a regular Amtrak trip and it\u2019s also a great way to support an organization that is working to preserve Washington State history. Now if you still need a little nudge, the railroad also runs themed trains throughout the year and even wine tastings on specific weekend nights.
